290 MM,1956,"Designed for the 1956 Mille Miglia and as a replacement for the 860 Monza, the 290MM was mounted with a V12 engine with dual ignition and dry sump derived from the 4.5-litre Grand Prix. Even though this engine could be described as belonging to Lampredi school, its bore and stroke measurements were really more reminiscent of Colombo’s V12 than anything else. The car was an immediate success.

860 Monza,1956,"A development of the 750 Monza, the 860 Monza used a bigger displacement, 3,431 cc version of the four-cylinder engine in the run up to the arrival of the new V12s. After a rather low key debut at the Tourist Trophy, it was sent to the US where Phil Hill drove it to victory at Nassau. An improved version, driven by Collins and Musso, also went on to take second and third in the Mille Miglia behind the new 290 MM.

The car itself was unveiled to the public later, at the 1956 Brussels Motor Show. The elegant bodywork with its impressive dimensions was the work of Pinin Farina.

As a result the reliable V12 from the 250 Gran Turismo was used albeit with a radically tuned with six twin-choke carburettors.

275 GTB Competizione,1965,"At least two prototypes of this model were built in 1965. The story goes that the bodywork, created as always by Pininfarina, was supposed to have been for the new berlinetta.  However, Enzo Ferrari scotched the proposal and the cars already built were initially put into storage. They were later reworked and lightened to make them more suitable for racing and went on to take part in the Targa Florio, the 1000 km at the Nürburgring and the 24 hours of Le Mans in 1965. The latter was a truly tough race and the Ecurie Francorchamps car, with Willy Mairesse and “Beurlys” (the pseudonym of millionaire Jean Blaton), came home third overall behind two 250 LMs and also took first in the GT class.

The first development came in 1965 with the 275 P2 which stood alongside the very similar 330 P2 from which it differed only in terms of the latter’s larger displacement.

360 Challenge,2000,"Ferrari’s GT cars have always been highly competitive in the hands of privateers, and their racing achievements have played a fundamental role in the company’s motor sport history. That’s why the Ferrari Challenge one-make racing series was created – it was Ferrari’s way of getting owners of its road-going GT cars back on the track. The idea for a specific competition for the 8-cylinder cars first became reality back in 1993 with the 348 Berlinetta. In 1995 it was the turn of the F355, thanks to a special kit developed in-house by Ferrari. The 2000 season saw the debut of the 400-bhp, V8-engined 360 Modena Challenge alongside the F355.
